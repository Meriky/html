  <p>The defining instance of an element, attribute, or API is marked up like <dfn><code

  <p>In some cases, requirements are given in the form of lists with conditions and corresponding
  requirements. In such cases, the requirements that apply to a condition are always the first set
  of requirements that follow the condition, even in the case of there being multiple sets of
  conditions for those requirements. Such cases are presented as follows:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>This is a condition
   <dt>This is another condition
   <dd>This is the requirement that applies to the conditions above.

   <dt>This is a third condition
   <dd>This is the requirement that applies to the third condition.
